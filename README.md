# AMIGA Goodies

These are a few KiCad projects for PCBs that I created when dealing
with my Amigas. The PCBs might be useful for other people, so here they are.

All the PCBs are open hardware and free to use subject to the terms of
the GPLv2 licence. Refer to the file LICENSE for further details.

## FloppySwap

This is a Floppy-Swapper using a multiplexer 74HCT153 instead of an
elaborate mechanical switch. As it turns out this is more reliable and
even cheaper than the purely mechanical approach. As an extra benefit,
you can combine this with the Key-Tap to use your Keyboard to swap the
drives.

## CPU-Tap

A simple PCB that allows tapping the Processor signals on a .1" Pin
Header. Very useful for setting up a debugging rig.
